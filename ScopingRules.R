       # In function g(), the value of y is 10. i.e. Lexical scoping

# With lexical scoping the value of y in the function g is looked up
# in the environment in which the function was defined, in this case 
# the global environment, so the value of y is 10. With dynamic
# scoping, the value of y is looked up in the environment from which
# the function was called (sometimes referred to as the calling 
# environment). In R the calling environment is known as the
# parent frame. In this case, the value of y would be 2.

# When a function is defined in the global environment and is 
# subsequently called from the global environment, then the
# defining environment and the calling environment are the same. 
# This can sometimes give the appearance of dynamic scoping.
